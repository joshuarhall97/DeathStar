LINE 1: [DEATH STAR PLANS]
LINE 2: 	A comprehensive guide to constructing the ultimate space station.
LINE 3:
LINE 4: [SECTION 1: OVERVIEW]
LINE 5: 	The Death Star is a moon-sized military space station with the capability to destroy entire planets.
LINE 6: 	Purpose: To enforce peace through the galaxy via superior firepower.
LINE 7:
LINE 8: [SECTION 2: DIMENSIONS]
LINE 9: 	Diameter: Approx. 160 km
LINE 10: 	Comprising thousands of levels and compartments.
LINE 11:
LINE 12: [SECTION 3: SUPERLASER]
LINE 13: 	Central weapon system.
LINE 14: 	Powered by massive kyber crystals.
LINE 15: 	Capable of obliterating entire planets with a single shot.
LINE 16:
LINE 17: [SECTION 4: DEFENSE SYSTEMS]
LINE 18: 	Protected by an energy shield.
LINE 19: 	Turbolaser towers and TIE fighters for defense against starships.
LINE 20:
LINE 21: [SECTION 5: PROPULSION]
LINE 22: 	Equipped with hyperdrive and sublight engines.
LINE 23: 	Powered by a hypermatter reactor.
LINE 24:
LINE 25: [SECTION 6: VULNERABILITIES]
LINE 26: 	There is a thermal exhaust port leading to the main reactor.
LINE 27: 	The exhaust port is ray shielded, so only proton torpedoes can enter.
LINE 28: 	The exhaust port is small, approximately 2 meters wide, just large enough for proton torpedoes to make it through.
LINE 29: 	A direct hit to the exhaust port with proton torpedoes will cause a chain reaction leading to the destruction of the Death Star.
